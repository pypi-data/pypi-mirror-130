    'long_description': "# dbtenv\n\ndbtenv lets you easily install and run multiple versions of [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) with [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), or optionally using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on Mac or Linux.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) if you haven't already.\n2. Run `pipx install dbtenv`.\n\n\n## How it works\n\nRun `dbtenv --help` to see some overall documentation for dbtenv, including its available sub-commands, and run `dbtenv <sub-command> --help` to see documentation for that sub-command.\n\n### Using pip and/or Homebrew\nBy default dbtenv uses [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) to install dbt versions from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/dbt/#history) into Python virtual environments within `~/.dbt/versions`.\n\nHowever, on Mac or Linux systems dbtenv will automatically detect and use any version-specific dbt installations from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (e.g. `dbt@0.19.0` but not plain `dbt`), and you can have dbtenv use Homebrew to install new dbt versions by setting a `DBTENV_DEFAULT_INSTALLER=homebrew` environment variable, or specifying `--installer homebrew` when running `dbtenv install`.\n\n### Installing dbt versions\nYou can run `dbtenv versions` to list the versions of dbt available to install, and run `dbtenv install <version>` to install a version.\n\nIf you don't want to have to run `dbtenv install <version>` manually, you can set a `DBTENV_AUTO_INSTALL=true` environment variable so that as you run commands like `dbtenv version` or `dbtenv execute` any dbt version specified that isn't already installed will be installed automatically.\n\nSome tips when dbtenv is using pip:\n- You can customize where the dbt version-specific Python virtual environments are created by setting `DBTENV_VENVS_DIRECTORY` and `DBTENV_VENVS_PREFIX` environment variables.\n- You can have dbtenv only install Python packages that were actually available on the date the dbt version was released by setting a `DBTENV_SIMULATE_RELEASE_DATE=true` environment variable, or specifying `--simulate-release-date` when running `dbtenv install`.\n  This can help if newer versions of dbt's dependencies are causing installation problems.\n- By default dbtenv uses whichever Python version it was installed with to install dbt, but that can be changed by setting a `DBTENV_PYTHON` environment variable to the path of a different Python executable, or specifying `--python <path>` when running `dbtenv install`.\n\n### Switching between dbt versions\ndbtenv determines which dbt version to use by trying to read it from the following sources, in this order, using the first one it finds:\n\n1. The `dbtenv execute` command's optional `--dbt <version>` argument.\n2. A `DBT_VERSION` environment variable.\n3. A `.dbt_version` file in the dbt project directory.\n4. The [dbt version requirements](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/require-dbt-version/) of the dbt project and any dbt packages it uses.\n   - If the dbt version requirements specify a range of versions rather than an exact version, then dbtenv will try to read a preferred dbt version from the sources below and will use that version if it's compatible with the requirements.\n5. The first `.dbt_version` file found by searching the dbt project's parent directories.\n6. The `~/.dbt/version` file.\n7. The max installed dbt version (preferring stable versions).\n8. The max installable dbt version (preferring stable versions).\n\nYou can:\n- Run `dbtenv version` to show which dbt version dbtenv determines dynamically based on the current environment.\n- Run `dbtenv which` to show the full path to the executable of the dbt version dbtenv determines dynamically based on the current environment.\n- Run `dbtenv version --global <version>` to set the dbt version globally in the `~/.dbt/version` file.\n- Run `dbtenv version --local <version>` to set the dbt version for the current directory in a `.dbt_version` file.\n\n### Running dbt versions\nRun `dbtenv execute -- <dbt arguments>` to execute the dbt version determined dynamically based on the current environment, or run `dbtenv execute --dbt <version> -- <dbt arguments>` to execute the specified dbt version.\n\nFor example:\n- `dbtenv execute -- run` will execute `dbt run` using the version determined dynamically based on the current environment.\n- `dbtenv execute --dbt 0.19.0 -- run` will execute `dbt run` using dbt 0.19.0.\n\n**Important:**  It's highly recommended to put two dashes with spaces on both sides before the list of dbt arguments (as shown in the examples above) so that dbtenv doesn't try to interpret the dbt arguments itself.\n\n### Running dbt with dbtenv more seamlessly\nFor a more seamless experience you can define a `dbt` alias or function in your shell to run `dbtenv execute -- <dbt arguments>` and dynamically determine which dbt version to use whenever you type dbt commands like `dbt run` or `dbt test`.\n\nSome examples:\n- In **bash** you could add the following alias in your `~/.bash_profile` file:\n  ```bash\n  alias dbt='dbtenv execute --'\n  ```\n- In **Windows PowerShell** aliases can't include additional arguments, but you could add the following function in your `~\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file:\n  ```PowerShell\n  function\xa0dbt\xa0{\xa0dbtenv\xa0execute\xa0--\xa0@Args\xa0}\n  ```\n\nNote that after adding such a `dbt` alias/function to your shell profile you'll need to reload the profile to activate it (e.g. by running `. ~/.bash_profile` in bash, or `. $PROFILE` in PowerShell).\n\n### Uninstalling dbt versions\nYou can run `dbtenv versions --installed` to list the versions of dbt that dbtenv has installed in Python virtual environments and/or with Homebrew, and then run `dbtenv uninstall <version>` to uninstall a version.\n\n\n## Development\n\n### Development setup\n1. Clone this repository onto your computer.\n2. Install Poetry `pipx install poetry` ([What is pipx?](https://www.google.com/search?q=pipx&rlz=1C5GCEM_enGB953GB953&oq=Pipx&aqs=chrome.0.69i59i512j0i512l2j69i59j0i512l2j69i60l2.1010j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))\n3. Install this project into a virtual environment `poetry install`\n4. Activate the virtual environment `poetry shell`\n5. Any `dbtenv` commands will run using the local version of the project.\n",
