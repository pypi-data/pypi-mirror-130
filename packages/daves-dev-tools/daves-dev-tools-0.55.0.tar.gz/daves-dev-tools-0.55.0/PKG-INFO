# daves-dev-tools

This project provides command line utilities for performing common python
development tasks.

## Installation

You can install daves-dev-tools with pip:

```shell
pip3 install daves-dev-tools
```

In order to use some features of this library, you will need to specify
one or more *extras*:
- "cerberus": This extra installs requirements needed in order to import
  `daves_dev_tools.cerberus`, which provides utilities for interacting
  with a [Cerberus](https://engineering.nike.com/cerberus/) vault.
  ```shell
  pip3 install daves-dev-tools[cerberus]
  ```

To install this project for development of *this library*,
clone this repository (replacing "~/Code", below, with the directory
under which you want your project to reside), then run `make`:
```shell script
cd ~/Code && \
git clone\
 https://github.com/enorganic/daves-dev-tools.git\
 daves-dev-tools && \
cd daves-dev-tools && \
make
```

                                        [requirement [requirement ...]]

This command will attempt to find and install, in develop (editable) mode, all packages which are installed in the current
python environment. If one or more `requirement` file paths or specifiers are provided, installation will be limited to the
dependencies identified (recursively) by these requirements. Exclusions can be specified using the `-e` parameter. Directories
can be excluded by passing regular expressions to the `-edre` parameter.

positional arguments:
  requirement           One or more requirement specifiers or configuration file paths. If provided, only dependencies of these
                        requirements will be installed.

  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        A directory in which to search for requirements. By default, the directory above the current directory
                        is searched. This argument may be passed more than once to include multiple locations.
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                        A comma-separated list of distribution names to exclude
  -edre EXCLUDE_DIRECTORY_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, --exclude-directory-regular-expression EXCLUDE_DIRECTORY_REGULAR_EXPRESSION

                        argument may be passed more than once to exclude directories matching more than one regular expression.
                        The default for this argument is equivalent to `-edre '^[.~].*$' -edre '^venv$' -edre '^site-packages$'`
  -dr, --dry-run        Print, but do not execute, all `pip install` commands
  -ie, --include-extras
                        Install all extras for all discovered distributions
