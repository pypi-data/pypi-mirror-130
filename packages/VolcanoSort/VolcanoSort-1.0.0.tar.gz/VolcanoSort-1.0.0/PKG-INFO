# :volcano: Volcano Sort
The hottest sorting algorithm around!

### Disclaimer
This algorithm runs in O(n<sup>2</sup>). Please don't use this.

### Motivation
Our professor mentioned volcanoes when discussing sorting algorithms. I realized there wasn't a "Volcano Sort". There shouldn't be, but now there is.

### Methodology
This algorithm first constructs a volcano from the input. Then, the volcano "erupts" and places the numbers in sorted order. 

What does this mean?

Given the following input: [4,8,2,2,1,3,0], Volcano Sort will construct a volcano: [1,2,4,8,3,2,0]. It looks like this:

The volcano will erupt and place numbers in increasing order. 

Output: [0,1,2,2,3,4,8]

### Future Development
None!
