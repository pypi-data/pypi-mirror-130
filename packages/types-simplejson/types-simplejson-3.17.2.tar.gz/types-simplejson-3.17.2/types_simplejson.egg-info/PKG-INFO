## Typing stubs for simplejson

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `simplejson` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `simplejson`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/simplejson. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `2610c5ee379ef2acfc964857544929097ac704a1`.
