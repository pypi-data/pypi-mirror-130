# Real Time Video Reader
This project aims to read the video  from the computer screen and process it
using the Canny edges to detect lines.

Allows to adjust the parameters of the Canny detection in real time through
slide vars.

It is advisable to have 2 monitors (one being captured real time and another
that is showing the canny edges)

When not having 2 monitors reduce the captured screen so the capture and The
canny fit in one screen.

## Usage of the package
Start playing some video and then choose one of the options below. For example
if you want to work on traffic detection / signal detection you can use:

### You don't know the region to capture
    from cannyfier import get_capture_coords
    from cannyfier import Cannyfier

    # This will create a window called InitWindow.
    # 1. Move the window out of the view of the screen part you want to capture.
    # 2. Click + Drag and Release in the window created to define the capture
         box.
    # 3. You can re-define the box by click again + drag and realease
    # 4. Once satisfied with the capture box press q
    ix, fx, iy, fy = get_capture_coords()

    # 5. This part will be executed then. The capture window will be displayed
    #    with an smaller window with 2 slide bars
    # 6. Move both windows out of the view of the capture box
    # 7. Adjust the sliders to your taste of cannyfier
    # 8. To finish the cannyfier press also q
    my_cann = Cannyfier(ix, iy, fx, fy)

    # System will report you:
    # 1. The region being captured (left, top, right bottom)
    # 2. The average frames per second captured during the cannyfier process

### You know the region to capture (x, y, x, y)
    from cannyfier import Cannyfier

    # Capture window will be displayed with an smaller window with 2 slide bars
    # 1. Move both windows out of the view of the capture box
    # 2. Adjust the sliders to your taste of cannyfier
    # 3. To finish the cannyfier press also q
    my_cann = Cannyfier(ix, iy, fx, fy)

    # System will report you:
    # 1. The region being captured (left, top, right bottom)
    # 2. The average frames per second captured during the cannyfier process


## Remarks
**Press q to exit the program**
**To define the box start always left top and end right bottom**
