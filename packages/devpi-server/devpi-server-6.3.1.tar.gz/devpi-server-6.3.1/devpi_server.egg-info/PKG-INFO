devpi-server: server for private package indexes and PyPI caching
=============================================================================


PyPI cache
==========

You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
index, serving as a transparent cache for pypi-hosted packages.


User specific indexes
=====================

Each user (which can represent a person, project or team) can have
multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``twine`` or
``setup.py`` invocations.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through
`devpi-client`_ and a RESTful HTTP API.


Index inheritance
=================

Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
release candidate before you push it to PyPI.


Good defaults and easy deployment
=================================

Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and process managers.


Separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
==============================================

The complementary `devpi-client`_ tool
helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
installation workflows.

See https://doc.devpi.net on how to get started and further documentation.

.. towncrier release notes start

6.3.1 (2021-12-04)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix #864: enable settings from ``~/.netrc`` and ``HTTP_PROXY``/``HTTPS_PROXY`` env vars for aiohttp.


6.3.0 (2021-11-19)
==================

Features
--------

- Use aiohttp (asyncio) for fetching release links from mirrors to return stale links immediately in case of a timeout, but update the database in the background for the next request.


Bug Fixes
---------

- fix #853: prevent duplicate mirror indexes in sro method when there are multiple inheritance chains to the same mirror

- fix #860: don't check for existing files and validate them during mirror links update, the operation is way to expensive and there is a low possibility for errors.

- Add missing `lazy` package dependency. Previously this was only a transitive dependency coming from the devpi-common package.


6.2.0 (2021-08-12)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Optimized some database access patterns. A new index is added to the database on first startup. For large databases that can take a while.

- Improved performance of loads from database.

- Optimized memory and cache use for database access.

- Use frozenset for project name cache of mirror indexes. This mitigates memory fragmentation on some Linux distributions.


6.1.0 (2021-07-11)
==================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Renamed 'pypi_submit' permission to 'upload'. The old permission still works, but will be removed in a later major release.


Features
--------

- Allow patching index with same json layout as the output of fetching json for an index.

- Allow user and index URLs to work with a trailing slash.


Bug Fixes
---------

- fix #631: race condition in fetching project links from mirrors.


6.0.1 (2021-06-23)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- fix #843: add explicit ruamel.yaml dependency declaration after strictyaml vendored it.
