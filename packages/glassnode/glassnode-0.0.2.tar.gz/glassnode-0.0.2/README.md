**Glassnode API client for python.**

## Overview
This is a very simple and intuitive library for accessing the Glassnode API.

## Quick Start

To start using the library, first install the package.
```bash
pip install glassnode
```
Then, just instanciate the `GlassnodeClient` providing your API key and start making requests.
Here's a code sample that demonstrates how to get the full history of BTC addresses count.
```python
from glassnode import GlassnodeClient

api_key = ""
client = GlassnodeClient(api_key)
data = client.get("addresses", "count", {"a": "BTC"})
```

## How to make requests
In order to request any metric, just call the `get` method on the `GlassnodeClient` instance passing the following parameters:

* **domain**: the metric's domain.
* **metric**: the metric name.
* **params**: the dict of the query parameters to pass along to the request.

The difference between **domain** and **metric** is actually very simple. Glassnode has designed it's API in a very modular and intuitive way, grouping metrics by domain.
All metrics endpoints follow this pattern: https://api.glassnode.com/v1/metrics/{domain}/{metric}.
For a complete list of **domains**, **metrics** and **params**, see their official API docs (https://docs.glassnode.com).

Here's another example. This time we'll use the client to get both the STH and LTH NUPL for the market cycle from the 2016 halving to the 2020 halving, with a 24h resolution.
```python
from  glassnode  import  GlassnodeClient

api_key = ""

client = GlassnodeClient(api_key)
since = 1589148000 # July 9 2016
until = 1468015200 # May 11 2020
resolution = "24h"
params = {"a": "BTC", "s": since, "u": until, "i": resolution}

sth_nupl = client.get("indicators", "nupl_less_155", params)
lth_nupl = client.get("indicators", "nupl_more_155", params)
```
