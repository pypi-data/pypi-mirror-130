# Key constants

# Additional settings
# (these settings/objects must be adjusted acc. to experimental conditions

class centering:
    '''
    Set parameters for determination of center of 4D-STEM datafiles.
    
    Typical usage
    -------------
    In a script, use the following two commands:
        
        >>> import stemdiff.const
        >>> CENTERING = stemdiff.const.centering(
        >>>     ctype=1,csquare=30,cintensity=0.8)
        
    Typical values of the arguments:
        
    * `ctype=1` ..fixed center, determined from the 1st file
    * `csquare=30` ..find center in a central square with size 30 pixels 
    * `cintensity=0.8` ..ignore intensities < 0.8 * maximal intensity
    
    Variable CENTERING, which contains the centering object,
    is usually employed as an argument in the functions
    that create database of files, determine PSF and sum datafiles.

        >>> import stemdiff.const
        >>> help(stemdiff.const.centering)
    '''
    
    def __init__(self, ctype=1, csquare=None, cintensity=None):
        '''
        Initialize parameters for center determination.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ctype : integer (values: 0, 1, 2)
            * 0 = intensity center not determined, geometrical center is used
            * 1 = center determined from the first image and kept constant
            * 2 = center is determined for each individual image
        csquare : integer (interval: 10--DET_SIZE)
            Size of the central square (in pixels),
            within which the center of intensity is searched for.
        cintensity : float (interval: 0--1)
            Intensity fraction, which is used for center determination.
            Example: cintensity=0.9 => take only pixels > 0.9 * max.intensity.

        Returns
        -------
        Centering object.

class summation:
    '''
    Set parameters for summation of 4D-STEM datafiles.
    
    Typical usage
    -------------
    In a script, use the following two commands:
        
        >>> import stemdiff.const
        >>> SUMMATION =
        >>>     stemdiff.const.summation(psfsize=130,imgsize=125,iterate=30)

    Typical values of the arguments:
    
    * `psfsize=130` ..size of a central square for PSF determination
    * `imgsize=125` ..size of a central square for summation
    * `iterate=30`  ..number of iterations during deconvolution
    * (psfsize > imgsize) => minimization of deconvolution artifacts
    * (imgsize < DET_SIZE) => ignore weak diffraction at the edges
    * (iterate=30) => a starting point; final number usually higher

    Variable SUMMATION, which contains the summation object,
    is usually employed as an argument in the functions
    that determine PSF and sum datafiles.

    In a console, use the following two commands:

    '''

    def __init__(self, psfsize=None, imgsize=None, iterate=None):
        '''
        Initialize parameters for summation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        psfize : integer (interval: something--DET_SIZE)
            Size/edge of central square, from which 2D-PSF will be determined.
        imgsize : integer (interval: something --DET_SIZE)
            Size of array read from the detector is reduced to imgsize.
            If given, we sum only the central square with size = imgsize.
            Smaller area = higher speed; outer area = just weak diffractions.   
        iterate : integer  
            Number of iterations during PSF deconvolution.

        Returns
        -------
        Summation object.
