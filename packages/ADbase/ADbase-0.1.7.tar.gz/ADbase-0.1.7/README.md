## Broader Impact and Inclusivity Statement
Our automatic differentiation library can lead to a number of benefits in a variety of fields. Since automatic differentiation can be used in fields like physics, statistics, and machine learning, our package has the potential to accelerate advances in those fields by facilitating the key process of automatic differentiation. One potential impact to be wary of is the fact that while the package can be used for many important scientific methods, we don't have much control over how the package is used on the user end. This means that the burden is on the user to use our package responsibly (i.e., if the user is using this package for machine learning, it's important to check that the input data is free of biases or error. Otherwise, this package will be used to perpetuate the biases present in the training data). Ultimately, this package is a tool, and like all tools, it's helpful for its presumed purpose but can be misused.

In addition, we've worked to make this package as accessible and easy to understand as possible, making its use approachable for anyone regardless of programming/mathematical experience. Our workflow for this project has also been inclusiveâ€”all pull requests are reviewed by other members of the team, giving everyone a hand in contributing to the code. The biggest barrier to access (both on the contributing side and the implementation side) is getting started. While we've attempted to document the code and make it intuitive enough that any user can get started with our package, the fact remains that the steps needed to install/start contributing to the package (creating a virtual environment, or getting started with git/test suites/version control), while not impossible to learn, can be intimidating to someone without a certain level of programming experience. Our hope is that these steps are easy enough to research that this intimidation can be overcome, but we do recognize that for underrepresented populations without as much access to CS education, an intimidating first step can be enough to dissuade someone from pursuing a project further.
