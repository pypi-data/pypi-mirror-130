## Mission statement 
`scivision` aims to be a well-documented and generalisable python framework for applying computer vision methods to a wide range of scientific imagery.

This tool aims to foster collaboration between **data owners** and **developers** by:
* Empowering scientific domain experts to easily access and integrate the latest CV tools
* Enabling algorithm developers to distribute their tools to users across scientific fields
* Evolving with a focus on the needs and priorities of both developers and users
* Creating and maintaining a community of interdisciplinary contributors
* Providing a bridge between different data scales and formats
