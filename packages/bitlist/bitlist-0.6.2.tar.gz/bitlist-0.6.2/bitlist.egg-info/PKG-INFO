Purpose
-------
This library allows programmers to work with a native representation of bit vectors within Python.

Package Installation and Usage
------------------------------
The package is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/bitlist/>`_::

    python -m pip install bitlist

The library can be imported in the usual way::

    import bitlist
    from bitlist import bitlist

A basic example of usage (a bitwise addition function) is provided below::

    from bitlist import bitlist

    def add(x, y):
        """Bitwise addition algorithm."""
        r = bitlist(0)

        # Upper bound is not inclusive.
        # Use negative indices for big-endian interface.
        carry = 0
        for i in range(1, max(len(x), len(y)) + 1):
            r[-i] = (x[-i] ^ y[-i]) ^ carry
            carry = (x[-i] & y[-i]) | (x[-i] & carry) | (y[-i] & carry)
        r[-(max(len(x), len(y)) + 1)] = carry

        return r

The testing suite ``test/test_bitlist.py`` contains additional examples of bitwise arithmetic operations implemented with the help of this library.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation can be generated automatically from the source files using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_::

    cd docs
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    sphinx-apidoc -f -E --templatedir=_templates -o _source .. ../setup.py && make html

Testing and Conventions
-----------------------
All unit tests are executed and their coverage is measured when using `nose <https://nose.readthedocs.io/>`_ (see ``setup.cfg`` for configuration details)::

    python -m pip install nose coverage
    nosetests --cover-erase

The subset of the unit tests included in the module itself can be executed using `doctest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>`_::

    python bitlist/bitlist.py -v

Style conventions are enforced using `Pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_::

    python -m pip install pylint
    pylint bitlist test/test_bitlist
