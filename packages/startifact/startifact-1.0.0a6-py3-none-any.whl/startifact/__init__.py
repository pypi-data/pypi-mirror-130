"""
**Startifact** is a command line application and Python package for staging and retrieving versioned artifacts in Amazon Web Services.

## Use cases

- Stage your application builds to deploy later.
- Discover the latest build to add to your release set.
- Download any build version to deploy.
- Attach your build's hash as metadata to read and verify later.

## Amazon Web Services

### How Startifact uses your account

Artifacts and metadata are stored in an S3 bucket that you must deploy yourself.

Your organisation configuration and the latest versions of staged artifacts are recorded in Systems Manager parameters that Startifact manages.

### S3 bucket

Startifact will not deploy an S3 bucket for you. You must deploy and own the security yourself.

Startifact requires your bucket's name to be readable from a Systems Manager parameter. This allows you to deploy a bucket without a hard-coded name but still discoverable. [Why do you care what your S3 buckets are named?](https://unbuild.blog/2021/12/why-do-you-care-what-your-s3-buckets-are-named/) explains why Startifact is opinionated.

Here's a complete CloudFormation template you can copy and deploy:

```yaml
Description: Artifact storage
Resources:
  Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
        BlockPublicAcls: true
        BlockPublicPolicy: true
        IgnorePublicAcls: true
        RestrictPublicBuckets: true

  BucketParameter:
    Type: AWS::SSM::Parameter
    Properties:
      # This name can be anything you want:
      Name: /artifacts-bucket
      Type: String
      Value:
        Ref: Bucket
```

### IAM policies

The user performing the one-time organisation setup must be granted:

- `ssm:GetParameter` and `ssm:PutParameter` on the configuration parameter. This is `arn:aws:ssm:{REGION}:{ACCOUNT ID}:parameter/Startifact` by default, but adjust if you are using a different parameter name.

Any identities that download artifacts must be granted:

- `ssm:GetParameter` on the configuration parameter.
- `ssm:GetParameter` on the bucket name parameter.
- `ssm:GetParameter` on every parameter beneath the name prefix (or *all* parameters if you have no name prefix).
- `s3:GetObject` on every S3 object in the artifacts bucket beneath the key prefix (or *all* objects if you have no key prefix).
- Optional: `s3:PutObject` on S3 keys ending with `*/metadata` to allow appending metadata to existing artifacts.

Any identities that stage artifacts must be granted:

- `ssm:GetParameter` on the configuration parameter.
- `ssm:GetParameter` on the bucket name parameter.
- `ssm:PutParameter` on every parameter beneath the name prefix (or *all* parameters if you have no name prefix).
- `s3:ListBucket` on the artifacts bucket.
- `s3:PutObject` on every S3 object in the artifacts bucket beneath the key prefix (or *all* objects if you have no key prefix).

## Installation

Startifact requires Python 3.8 or later.

Install Startifact via pip:

```bash
pip install startifact
```

## Organisation configuration

Startifact is designed to be run within organisations with multiple CI/CD pipelines that create versioned artifacts.

Rather than configure Startifact within each pipeline, Startifact reads from a shared organisation-level configuration in Systems Manager.

As long as your CI/CD pipelines all authenticate to the same Amazon Web Services account, they will read the same configuration.

### Choosing where to host the configuration

By default, Startifact reads and writes configuration to a Systems Manager parameter named `/Startifact` in your default account and region.

To change that parameter name, set an environment variable named `STARTIFACT_PARAMETER`.

### Performing or updating the organisation setup

Volunteer a privileged human being to run:

```bash
startifact --setup
```

They will be asked to:

1. Confirm the configuration parameter name, region and account.
1. Enter the name of the Systems Manager parameter holding the bucket's name. In the example template above, the parameter is named `/artifacts-bucket`.
1. Enter the name of the region that hosts the Systems Manager parameter that holds the bucket's name.
1. Enter the name of the region that hosts the bucket.
1. Optionally enter a bucket key prefix.
1. Enter the name of the region where artifacts should be recorded in Systems Manager.
1. Optionally enter a name prefix for the Systems Manager parameters that record artifact versions. Without a prefix, versions will be recorded as `/{project}/Latest`.
1. Confirm the configuration parameter name, region and account one last time before committing.

## Command line usage

### Staging an artifact via the CLI

To stage an artifact, pass the project name, version and `--stage` argument with the path to the file:

```text
startifact SugarWater 1.0.9000 --stage dist.tar.gz
```

Where the version number comes from depends on your CI/CD setup. For example, I use CircleCI and I stage artifacts on tags, so I know I can pull the version number from the `CIRCLE_TAG` environment variable:

```text
startifact SugarWater "${CIRCLE_TAG}" --stage dist.tar.gz
```

To attach metadata to the artifact, include any number of `--metadata` arguments. Each value must be a `key=value` pair. If the value contains multiple `=` characters then a pair will be made by splitting on the first.

```text
startifact SugarWater 1.0.9000 --stage dist.tar.gz --metadata lang=dotnet --metadata hash=9876=
```

To perform a dry run, swap `--stage` for `--dry-run`:

```text
startifact SugarWater 1.0.9000 --dry-run dist.tar.gz
```

### Getting the latest artifact version via the CLI

To get the version number of the latest artifact staged for a project, pass the project name and `--get` argument for `version`:

```text
startifact SugarWater --get version
```

The version number will be emitted to `stdout`.

### Downloading an artifact via the CLI

To download an artifact, pass the project name, *optionally* the version number, and the `--download` argument with the path to download to:

```text
startifact SugarWater 1.0.9000 --download download.tar.gz
```

If the version is omitted or `latest` then the latest artifact will be downloaded, otherwise the literal version will be downloaded.

## Python usage

### Staging an artifact via Python

```python
from startifact import Session

session = Session()
session.stage("SugarWater", "1.0.9000", path="dist.tar.gz")
```

Metadata can be attached in the same call:

```python
from startifact import Session

session = Session()
session.stage(
    "SugarWater",
    "1.0.9000",
    metadata={
        "lang": "dotnet",
        "hash": "9876=",
    },
    path="dist.tar.gz",
)
```

### Getting the latest artifact version via Python

```python
from startifact import Session

session = Session()
artifact = session.get("SugarWater")
print(artifact.version)
```

### Downloading an artifact via Python

```python
from startifact import Session

session = Session()
artifact = session.get("SugarWater", "1.0.9000)
artifact.download("download.tar.gz")
```

### Reading and appending metadata

Metadata can be added to any artifact, but values cannot be removed or modified. History can't be changed.

```python
from startifact import Session

session = Session()
artifact = session.get("SugarWater", "1.0.9000)

language = artifact["lang"]

artifact["deployed"] = "true"
artifact.save_metadata()
```
