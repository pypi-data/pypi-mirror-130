# vomit
________
Don't like using .pop() because it looks weird?

LOOK NO FURTHER

The vomit package contains a vomit() function which does the same thing as
.pop(). If you really think about it, when you pop and element from a stack (Last One First Out)
it's basically vomitting.


## install
    pip install vomit

If that doesnt work try:

    pip3 install vomit

## usage

```py
from vomit import vomit
stack = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

puke = vomit(stack)
# puke = 5

# stack = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
