## About

**Chi** is an open source Python package hosted on GitHub,
which can be used to model dose response dynamics.

All features of our software are described in detail in our
[full API documentation](https://chi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting started
### Installation

1. Install CVODES

Chi uses the open-source package Myokit to solve mechanistic models
and compute their sensitivities efficiently. Myokit does this using CVODESS,
which need to be installed with:

- On Ubuntu:
```bash
apt-get install libsundials-dev
```

- On MacOS:
```bash
brew install sundials
```

- On Windows: No action required. Myokit will install CVODESS automatically.

2. Install chi
```bash
pip install chi-drm
```

### Usage
 You can now use chi's functionality by importing it
 ```python
import chi
 ```

 Tutorials and more detailed explanations on how to use chi are currently
 under development.
