# tjc-gym
Traffic Juntion Continuous (tjc) is an extended version of the environment Traffic Junction, defined in [Learning Multiagent Communication
with Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07736.pdf). The environment is based on OpenAI Gym and has an continouos action space where the original is discrete.
