Description: # vmail-cli
        
        **DISCLAIMER: THIS APPLICATION IS STILL IN ALPHA/BETA STATE. DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTIVE ENVIRONMENTS IF YOU DON'T WHAT YOU'RE DOING!**
        
        `vmail-cli` is a command line tool and library for managing a mail-server
        database based on the great [HowTo](https://thomas-leister.de/en/mailserver-debian-stretch)
        from [Thomas Leister](https://thomas-leister.de) written in Python 3. Although
        the tutorial is using a MySQL/MariaDB database, this command line tool also
        supports other backends.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Python 3 (>= 3.7)
        
        You should use a dedicated and non-privileged user account to run this CLI. You
        could also rely on the packages provided by your GNU/Linux distribution. On a
        Debian-based host, you can install the following packages:
        - `python3-click`
        - `python3-passlib`
        - `python3-sqlalchemy`, with `python3-mysqldb` to use a MySQL database or
          `python3-psycopg2` for PostgreSQL
        - `python3-tabulate`
        - `python3-yaml`
        - `python3-argon2` for Argon2 password hashing (optional)
        
        Finally, you should follow the tutorial to have a working mail setup with
        Postfix and Dovecot. Note that the database tables will automatically be
        created by this CLI as needed.
        
        ## Installation
        ### Via pip
        
        Install it with:
        
        ```sh
        pip3 install --user vmail-cli
        ```
        
        ### Manually (for development)
        
        Clone this repository or download the sources on your local machine, and go into
        this directory.
        
        Install all requirements with:
        
        ```sh
        pip3 install -e .[test]
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        
        You can create your local configuration thanks to the wizard:
        
        ```sh
        vmail-cli config init
        ```
        
        You will have to create the database and the user if it is not already done. For
        a MariaDB database, this can be done with:
        
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE vmail;
        GRANT ALL ON vmail.* TO 'vmail-cli'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your-password';
        ```
        
        Note that the local configuration is stored in a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file
        loaded by [confuse](https://confuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#search-paths).
        It should be located in ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vmail/config.yaml`` or
        ``~/.config/vmail/config.yaml`` on GNU/Linux. You could have a look at the
        [default configuration](vmail/config_default.yaml) for available parameters.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Use the `--help` argument to list available commands with their options:
        
        ```sh
        vmail-cli --help
        ```
