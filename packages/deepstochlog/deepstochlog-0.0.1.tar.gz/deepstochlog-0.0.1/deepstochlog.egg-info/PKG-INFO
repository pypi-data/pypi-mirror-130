Description: # DeepStochLog
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Installing SWI Prolog
        DeepStochLog requires [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/PPA.html) to run.
        Run the following commands to install:
        ```
        sudo apt-add-repository ppa:swi-prolog/stable
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install swi-prolog
        ```
        
        ### Installing DeepStochLog package
        To install DeepStochLog itself, you can download this repository and run the following command:
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Running the examples
        
        ### Local dependencies
        
        To see DeepStochLog in action, please first install [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/PPA.html) (as explained about),
        as well as the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ### Datasets
        The datasets used in the tasks used to evaluate DeepStochLog can be found in our [initial release](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/deepstochlog/releases/tag/0.0.1).
        
        ### Addition example
        
        To see DeepStochLog in action, navigate to `examples/addition` and run `addition.py`.
        
        The neural definite clause grammar specification is provided in `addition.pl`.
        The `addition(N)` predicate specifies/recognises that two handwritten digits *N1* and *N2* sum to *N*.
        The neural probability `nn(number, [X], Y, digit)` makes the neural network with name `number` (a MNIST classifier) label input image X with the digit Y.
