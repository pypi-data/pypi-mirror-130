    """
    Fits the baseline using asymmetric least squares (AsLS) fitting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points. Must not
        contain missing data (NaN) or Inf.
    lam : float, optional
        The smoothing parameter. Larger values will create smoother baselines.
        Default is 1e6.
    p : float, optional
        The penalizing weighting factor. Must be between 0 and 1. Values greater
        than the baseline will be given `p` weight, and values less than the baseline
        will be given `p - 1` weight. Default is 1e-2.
    diff_order : int, optional
        The order of the differential matrix. Must be greater than 0. Default is 2
        (second order differential matrix). Typical values are 2 or 1.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The max number of fit iterations. Default is 50.
    tol : float, optional
        The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
    weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The weighting array. If None (default), then the initial weights
        will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    params : dict
        A dictionary with the following items:

        * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The weight array used for fitting the data.
        * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
            An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
            each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
            completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
            `tol` value, then the function did not converge.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if `p` is not between 0 and 1.

    ------
    ValueError

    Notes
    -----
    The weighting uses an asymmetric coefficient (`k` in the asPLS paper) of 0.5 instead
    of the 2 listed in the asPLS paper. pybaselines uses the factor of 0.5 since it
    matches the results in Table 2 and Figure 5 of the asPLS paper closer than the
    factor of 2 and fits noisy data much better.

    """
    Peaked Signal's Asymmetric Least Squares Algorithm (psalsa).

    Similar to the asymmetric least squares (AsLS) algorithm, but applies an
    exponential decay weighting to values greater than the baseline to allow
    using a higher `p` value to better fit noisy data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape (N,)
        The y-values of the measured data, with N data points. Must not
        contain missing data (NaN) or Inf.
    lam : float, optional
        The smoothing parameter. Larger values will create smoother baselines.
        Default is 1e6.
    p : float, optional
        The penalizing weighting factor. Must be between 0 and 1. Values greater
        than the baseline will be given `p` weight, and values less than the baseline
        will be given `p - 1` weight. Default is 0.5.
    k : float, optional
        A factor that controls the exponential decay of the weights for baseline
        values greater than the data. Should be approximately the height at which
        a value could be considered a peak. Default is None, which sets `k` to
        one-tenth of the standard deviation of the input data. A large k value
        will produce similar results to :func:`.asls`.
    diff_order : int, optional
        The order of the differential matrix. Must be greater than 0. Default is 2
        (second order differential matrix). Typical values are 2 or 1.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The max number of fit iterations. Default is 50.
    tol : float, optional
        The exit criteria. Default is 1e-3.
    weights : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The weighting array. If None (default), then the initial weights
        will be an array with size equal to N and all values set to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    baseline : numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
        The calculated baseline.
    params : dict
        A dictionary with the following items:

        * 'weights': numpy.ndarray, shape (N,)
            The weight array used for fitting the data.
        * 'tol_history': numpy.ndarray
            An array containing the calculated tolerance values for
            each iteration. The length of the array is the number of iterations
            completed. If the last value in the array is greater than the input
            `tol` value, then the function did not converge.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Raised if `p` is not between 0 and 1.

    Notes
    -----
    The exit criteria for the original algorithm was to check whether the signs
    of the residuals do not change between two iterations, but the comparison of
    the l2 norms of the weight arrays between iterations is used instead to be
    more comparable to other Whittaker-smoothing-based algorithms.
