I donâ€™t think I made myself clear enough before, I have had MyC loud Version 5 installed for over a year on the PR4100 but, there was a new version 5 update automatically installed on October 30, 2021 with version 5.18.117 and since that update, we have not been able to access the PR4100 locally through the network.  We can however access the PR4100 using the mycloud.com web access.  The PR4100 is connected to the internet with the Google Nest router and we are able to access the dashboard pages with no issues.  Please find the attached error we get after accessing the PR4100 a second time after reboot and any time thereafter.  Thank you in advance.  Brent D. Beck"""]
