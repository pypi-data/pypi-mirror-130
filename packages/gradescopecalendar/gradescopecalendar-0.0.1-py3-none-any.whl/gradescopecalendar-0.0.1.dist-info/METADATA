# Gradescope-Calendar

This script scrapes your Gradescope account for courses and assignment details. Assignment details currently can be transferred to iCalendar events (and then imported to other calendar applications such as Google Calendar). Another method exists to write these assignment details directly to a Google Calendar but requires additional setup. Scraping the Gradescope website is largely based off of the projects this is forked from.
