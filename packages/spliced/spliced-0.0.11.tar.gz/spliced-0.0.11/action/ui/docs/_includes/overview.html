Ths is a component of the [BUILD SI](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/build) project where we aim to: 

<ol>
<li>develop models of application binary interface compatibility </li>
<li>perform "splices" across binaries and libraries using spack</li>
<li>for each splice, make a prediction with some model if the binary will still work </li>
<li>test the actual spliced binary to validate the prediction. </li>
</ol>

For more details about this small pipeline, see the [buildsi/spack-splices](https://github.com/buildsi/spack-splices) and [spack-monitor-analysis](https://github.com/buildsi/spack-monitor-analysis/) repositories.
