Description: # CAESAR CIPHER
        
        Caesar cipher is a Python library for dealing with encode and decode.
        
        ## Algorithm of Caesar Cipher
        The algorithm of Caesar cipher holds the following features −
        
        1.Caesar Cipher Technique is the simple and easy method of encryption technique.
        
        2.It is simple type of substitution cipher.
        
        3.Each letter of plain text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down with alphabet.
        
        The following diagram depicts the working of Caesar cipher algorithm implementation

        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.
        
        ```bash
        pip install caesar_cipher coming soon
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import caesar_cipher coming soon
        
        # encoded
        caesar.encode.('hello')
        # returns 'mjqqt'
        
        # decoded
        caesar.decode('mjqqt')
        #returns 'hello'
        
        
        ```
