Description: # CAESAR CIPHER
        
        Caesar cipher is a Python library for dealing with encode and decode.
        
        ## Algorithm of Caesar Cipher
        The algorithm of Caesar cipher holds the following features âˆ’
        
        1.Caesar Cipher Technique is the simple and easy method of encryption technique.
        
        2.It is simple type of substitution cipher.
        
        3.Each letter of plain text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down with alphabet.
        
        The following diagram depicts the working of Caesar cipher algorithm implementation

        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.
        
        ```bash
        pip install caesar_cipher coming soon
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import caesar_cipher coming soon
        
        # encoded
        caesar.encode.('hello')
        # returns 'mjqqt'
        
        # decoded
        caesar.decode('mjqqt')
        #returns 'hello'
        
        
        ```
