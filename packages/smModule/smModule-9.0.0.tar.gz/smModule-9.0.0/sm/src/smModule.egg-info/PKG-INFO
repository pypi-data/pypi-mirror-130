####def fracture(
 - Calculates a fracture; param p(bool) if for printing the result => True/False;
 - If division-zero error is raised it

####def check_int(nZ)
 - Checks if the param nZ is an int; param p(bool) if for printing the number => True/False;
 - Returns a bool

####def N(nZ)
 - Checks if param nZ is a natural number; param p(bool) if for printing the number => True/False;
 - Returns a bool

####def Nu(nZ)
 - Checks if param nZ is part of the uneven numbers; param p(bool) if for printing the number => True/False;
 - Returns a bool

####def Ne(nZ)
 - Checks if param nZ is part of even numbers; param p(bool) if for printing the result => True/False;
 - Returns a bool

####def P(nZ)
 - Checks if param nZ is part of the prime numbers; param p(bool) if for printing the result => True/False;
 - Returns a bool

    => def INSERT()
    => def SELECT_ELEMETs()
    => def SELECT_ALL()
