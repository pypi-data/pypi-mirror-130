        version number: 0.0.7 author: Gavin Cooper
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        Psychopy sound analysis scripts.
        
        It contains one module that is a thin wrapper on the csv module to open
        a `Psychopy <http://www.psychopy.org/>`__ csv data file and provide an
        interface similar to the `prespy <https://github.com/gjcooper/prespy>`__
        library.
        
        The other module relies heavily on the sound card latency analyser
        functionality of the same ``prespy`` library in order to provide a
        similar interface as a command line script.
        
        Installation / Usage
        --------------------
        
        To install use pip:
        
        ::
        
           $ pip install psychosnd
        
        If you have a local version you can also use:
        
        ::
        
           $ pip install <path_to_package>/psychosnd-0.0.7.tar.gz
        
        To use the command line script, once installed you can run
        ``psych-scla <soundfile> <logfile>`` to analyse the difference in sound
        presentation times as recorded in each file.
        
        For the full procedure see the write up in the ``prespy`` documentation
        `here <https://github.com/gjcooper/prespy#scla-information>`__.
        
        For more information on the options you can pass to the scla command you
        can type in ``psych-scla --help`` for the full list.
