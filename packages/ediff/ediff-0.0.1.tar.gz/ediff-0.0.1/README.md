EDIFF :: processing of powder electron diffraction patterns
-----------------------------------------------------------

* *EDIFF* is a Python package that...
	- processes powder electron diffraction patterns
	- contains templates that can be used even by non-crystallographers
	- focuses on simple usage, but contains also several advanced features
* *EDIFF* is able to do the following:
	- to read image containing 2D powder electron diffraction patterns
	- to determine center of 2D powder diffration pattern center automatically
	- to convert 2D pattern to 1D diffractogram (radial averaging)
	- to remove background from 1D diffractogram (semi-automatically)
	- to calibrate experimental diffractogram (convert X-axis &rarr; vector q)
	- to calculate theoretical powder X-ray diffraction pattern
	- to compare experimental and theoretical diffraction patterns
