#### Error Parser
Everything is done in Python so it's extremely easy to install and use. Supports Python 3. Debuggy is used to execute scripts, it creates a wrap around the script with the help of sub processes, and listens for errors, capturing and parsing them through popular discussion forums. This is then styled and displayed on the terminal with the help of python curses.

## Usage
Simple Example:
By importing debuggy as the first (1st) line of your python script, it keeps track of the scripts run time and parses any error message encountered.

```python
    >>> import debuggy
```

You can also use debuggy comments to add comments to your code and make debugging earsier. Comments can be made before functions, classes and declaration of variables stating the function of the preceeding code block, if an error occurs withing the code block the comment is used to track proceedures to execute the function properly.

```python
    >>> from debuggy import comment 
    >>> comment('function to add two numbers')
    >>> def Add (x,y):
            return x + y    

```
The type of preceeding code block can also be specified ,whether it is a function,class or variable using the 'type' argument with either 'func','class','var' as the type parameter.
```python
    >>> from debuggy import comment 
    >>> comment(comment = 'function to add two numbers' ,type='func')
    >>> def Add (x,y):
            return x + y    

```
 #### Installation 

    $ pip install debuggy

    or apt-get if you're using Linux:

    $ sudo apt-get install debuggy
