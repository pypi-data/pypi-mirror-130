Nota bene: This was submitted on November 11 but under the name milestone2.md

### Task assigned for Milestone 2

Xiyu: Working on fixing the badges for Codecov and travis CI.

Eryk: Fixing additions/multiplication for x+x, xx, etc. Right now, our derivatives don't work for those operations involving the same node.

Raphael: Continue working on the NetworkX vizualisation, maybe add the operations as labels on the edges, etc. Implement pow, rpow, eq, lt, gt, etc...

Jean-Guillaume: Think of ideas for extension and start working on them already.

Everyone: Work on documentation.

Further steps: Do more extensions.

### What we have done since Milestone 1:

Eryk: Implemented Class Node (including backward pass, addition, multiplication etc...) and class Var. Implemented the wraper for derivatives. Worked on NetworkX vizualisation with Raphael.

Raphael: Basic tests of addition/multiplication/division implemented by Eryk. Implementation of log, neg, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Basic tests of log, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Worked on NetworkX vizualisation with Eryk.

Xiyu: TravisCI and CodeCov implementation: in progress.

Jean-Guillaume:
