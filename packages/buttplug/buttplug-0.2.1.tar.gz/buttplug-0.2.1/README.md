# DEPRECATION (at some point) WARNING

This project will be deprecated and archived at some point in the future (still not sure when that
is), with the Python implementation of buttplug moving to an FFI layer on top of buttplug-rs. Bugs
are currently being triaged from this library to buttplug-rs-ffi.

The new project will be at

[https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi/](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi/)

The API will change, though minimally (mostly connection in methods), and we will most likely still
distribute the pypi package under the same name ("buttplug").

You may continue to use this repo for the time being (so far it's been a year and I've gotten
nowhere on that upgrade, and this library still works fine!), just wanted everyone to be aware of
the changes happening in the near future.

Buttplug-py is a python implementation of the Core and Client portions of the Buttplug Sex Toy
Control Protocol. It allows users to write applications that can connect to Buttplug Servers, such
as the [Intiface Desktop Application](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-desktop) or [Intiface Rust CLI](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-cli-rs).
