### INSTALLATION

To install the Covid19Dashboard, the package can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable), similarly to the prerequisite modules necessary for the package to function. 

```bash
pip install Covid19Dashboard_ah1062
```

### USAGE

To set up the dashboard for opening in a browser, the user must execute the main.py python file in the package. This can be done through the command line, or a Python Shell if the file is loaded into an IDE such as IDLE, or another environment.

```bash
cd "<Directory_To_Package_Folder>"
py main.py
```

If the Package has been imported, the dashboard can be alternatively loaded by calling the run() function created in main.py, as opposed to the execution of app.run() when the module is being run directly.

```python
import Covid19Dashboard_ah1062 as Cov19Dashboard
Cov19Dashboard.main.run()
```

Once the dashboard is running, the local development server can be accessed by web browser, using the url **127.0.0.1:5000**.
