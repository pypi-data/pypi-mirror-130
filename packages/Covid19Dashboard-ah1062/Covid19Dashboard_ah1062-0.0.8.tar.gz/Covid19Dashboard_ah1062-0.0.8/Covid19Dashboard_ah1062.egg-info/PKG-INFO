```bash
pip install Covid19Dashboard
```

---
### **USAGE**
---

If the Package has been imported, the dashboard can be alternatively loaded by calling the run() function created in main.py, as opposed to the execution of app.run() when the module is being run directly.

```python
from Covid19Dashboard_ah1062 import dashboard
dashboard.run()
```

Once the dashboard is running, the local development server can be accessed by web browser, using the url **127.0.0.1:5000**.

### *<u>Testing</u>*

Functionality of the Package can be assessed via the use of pytest, or the calling of a pytest function from within dashboard.py

'''bash
cd <path/to/package>
pytest
'''

**OR**

'''python
from Covid19Dashboard_ah1062 import dashboard
dashboard.test_functions()
'''
