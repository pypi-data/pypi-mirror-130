# create_space subfolder

This subdirectory shows an example of how to create perturbations/noise and add them to the clean audio file. For downloading the original dataset, refer to the ***dataset*** subfolder in this repo.

This perturbation list is in no way exhaustive. For more elaborate information on the perturbations we use, refer to the original [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04460). As an example, we present exampls of all perturbation groups: white_noise, reverberation, Equalization, MP3_compression and Pops. The noise levels range from 0 to 100 -> the higher the level, the more the noise you want.
This subdirectory uses a few dependacies that are **not listed** in the **requirements.txt** file. Please make sure to install those first.
