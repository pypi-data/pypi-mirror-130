# blackduck-c-cpp

This code is responsible for running a c/cpp build wrapped by Coverity - capturing the source and binary files involved
and then using the available tools to deliver BDIO and signatures to Black Duck using a variety of tools and
methodologies.

## Overview

C and CPP projects don't have a standard package manager or method for managing dependencies. It is therefore more
difficult to create an accurate BOM for these projects. This leaves Software Composition Analysis tools fewer options
than with other languages. The primary options which are available in this context are: file system signatures. Black
Duck has a variety of old and new signatures which can be used to build a BOM. In order to effectively use signatures,
the tool first needs to know which files to take signatures from. In the past SCA tools have pointed a scanner at a
build directory, getting signatures from a subset of files within the directory sub-tree. The problem with this approach
is that there are many environmental variables, parameters and switches provided to the build tools, which make
reference to files outside of the build directory to include as part of the build. Further, there are, commonly, files
within the build directory, which are not part of the build and can lead to false positives within the BOM.

The new Black Duck C/CPP tool avoids the pitfalls described above by using a feature of Coverity called Build Capture.
Coverity Build Capture, wraps your build, observing all invocations of compilers and linkers and storing the paths of
all compiled source code, included header files and linked object files. These files are then matched using a variety of
methods described in the section of this document called "The BOM".

## Installation

Minimum version of Black Duck required is 2020.10.0

To install from pypi:

```
pip install blackduck-c-cpp
```

To install a specific version:

```
pip install blackduck-c-cpp==0.1.18b0
```

## Configuration

Prior to running your build, run any build specific configuration needed. Then the blackduck-c-cpp tool can either be
configured using a .yaml file or with command line arguments.

Here is a sample fully functional .yaml configuration: ardour-config.yaml

```
build_cmd: ../waf build
build_dir: /Users/theUser/myProject/ardour/build/
skip_build: False
verbose: True
project_name: ardour_mac
project_version: may-4-2021
bd_url: https://...
api_token: <token>
insecure: False
```

### API Token

Black Duck API tokens are generated on a per-user basis. To scan to a new project and view the results, the user who
generates the API token for blackduck-c-cpp must at minimum have the **Global Code Scanner**, **Global Project
Viewer**, and **Project Creator** roles assigned. To scan to an existing project and view the results, the user must at minimum have the project
assigned to their user, and have the **Project Code Scanner** role assigned. See Administration > Managing Black Duck
user accounts > Understanding roles in the Black Duck Help documentation for more details on user roles. The Black Duck
Help documentation is accessible through the Black Duck UI.

To generate an API token:

1. Go to the Black Duck UI and log in.
2. From the user menu located on the top navigation bar, select My Access Tokens.
3. Click Create New Token. The Create New Token dialog box appears.
4. Enter a name, description (optional), and select the scope for this token (to use with blackduck-c-cpp, must be **
   read and write access**).
5. Click Create. The Access Token Name dialog box appears with the access token.
6. Copy the access token shown in the dialog box. This token can only be viewed here at this time. Once you close the
   dialog box, you cannot view the value of this token.

```

#### Running

Once your blackduck-c-cpp tool is installed and configured as explained above, simply run the command:

blackduck-c-cpp --config /Users/theUser/myProject/ardour-config.yaml

To use snippet scanning, pass the snippet scanning parameters to the signature scanner using
--additional_sig_scan_args <snippet scanning parameter(s)>. Synopsys recommends using --snippet-matching. See "Running a
component scan using the Signature Scanner command line" in the Black Duck Help Guide for more details.

#### The Bom

Direct Dependencies - These are files which are being linked in to the built executable directly or header files
included by source code as identified by Coverity Build Capture.  
Package Manager - The Package Manager of the Linux system is queried about the source of the files - if recognized,
these are added to the BOM as "Direct Dependencies". Transitive Dependencies - These are files which are needed by the
Direct Dependencies. LDD - LDD is used to List the files (Dynamic Dependencies) of the Direct Dependencies. These files
are then used to query the package manager and results are added to the BOM as "Transitive Dependencies". Binary Matches
BDBA - Any linked object files not identified by the package manager are sent to BDBA (Binary) for matching. Signature
Matches - Any linked object and header files not identified by the package manager as well as all source code identified
by Coverity Build Capture are then sent to the Knowledge Base for signature matching.

## CI Builds

This projects CI build is run through GitLab-CI Pipelines, within this repository. When changes are made on
the `master` (default) branch, the version will be appended with `b` and the pipeline number as metadata. For `release/`
branches, `-rc` will be appended to the version with the pipeline number as metadata, and this will be published to
Artifactory. When changes are made to another branch (`dev/` or `bugfix/` for example), `dev` will be appended to the
version with the pipeline number, and the commit hash will be appended as metadata.

For example:

* default branch: 1.0.0b3821+abcd1234
* release branch: 1.0.0rc4820+abcd1234
* dev branch: 1.0.0dev5293+abcd1234
* release: 1.0.0

Release jobs are also run through GitLab-CI Pipelines, when tagged as per below. The version will be uploaded to
Artifactory at the end of the pipeline.

# Releasing

To release this library, simply tag this repo with a tag of the format: `vMM.mm.ff` like `v1.0.1`. This version should
match the version (minus the `v` in `setup.py`)

Be sure to increment the version in `setup.py` to the next fix version, or minor/major version as necessary. Do not add
any metadata or additional version information to the version, here.

The specific set of steps is:

- Ensure a full `python setup install` completes
- Commit changes
- Tag with `v##.##.##`, matching the version number in `setup.py`
- Push the change log changes, and tag, to GitLab
- Update the version number in `setup.py`
- Commit version change and push to GitLab
