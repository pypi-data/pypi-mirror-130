# APGD v.0.1.0

<!-- badges: start -->

Python version of the Accelerated Proximal Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm is to solve the penalized regression models, including 

- **HuberNet**: Huber loss function along with Network-based penalty function;
- **HuberLasso**: Huber loss function along with Lasso penalty function;
- **HuberENET**: Huber loss function along with Elastic Net penalty function;
- **ENET**: Mean square error loss function along with Elastic Net penalty function;
- **Lasso**: Mean square error loss function along with Lasso penalty function;
- **Net**: Mean square error loss function along with Network-based penalty function.
