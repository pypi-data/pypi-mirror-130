    "`osdatahub` gets its data from a service called \"OS Data Hub\". In order for the python package to get data from the Data Hub you need to have an account with the Data Hub and an API key. Creating an account only takes a few seconds, first navigate to the Data Hub homepage at https://osdatahub.os.uk/\r\n",

    "A project is a useful way of keeping track of how much data you are using. You could have multiple projects and then monitor the data use of each one. To create a project:\r\n",
    "- select \"API Dashboard\" in the header\r\n",
    "- then \"my projects\" in the menu on the left\r\n",
    "- and then create new project near the top right\r\n",

    "### Add API to project <a name=\"add-api\"></a>\r\n",
    "Now that you have a project you can choose what API services you want to add to the project. For example, you might need access to the OS features API and OS places API. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<span style=\"color: red\">Note that `osdatahub` currently only supports the Features and Places API. You can add other APIs to your APIs to your project, but you won't be able to get data from them via this package. </span>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To add an API to a project:\r\n",
    "- go to the API Dashbaord\r\n",
    "- Choose APIs on the left menu\r\n",
    "- Choose which API you want to add to your project (for this project select the Features API)\r\n",

    "## Using the api key <a name=\"use-api-key\" />\r\n",
    "After you have added an API to your project will be able to see the API project key in \"My projects\". This key will enable you to access all of the APIs you've added to your project. For example, if you create a project and add the Features and Places API then you don't need a separate key to access both services.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The rest of this example will show you how to make a simple query with `osdatahub`. Once you have copied the API we suggest following best practices and storing it as an environment variable - for this tutorial we store the API key as an environment variable called `OS_API_KEY`. Creating an environment variable is beyond the scope of this tutorial but you can find examples of how to do this online.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "<span style=\"color: red\">You can use `osdatahub` without setting an enviroment variable - this approach is also shown below - but this is discouraged. If you choose to use the paste the API directly into your sode make sure you don't have it publicly accessible.</span>\r\n",
