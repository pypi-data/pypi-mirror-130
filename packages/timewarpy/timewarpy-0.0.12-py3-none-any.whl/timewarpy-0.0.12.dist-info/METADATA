# TimeWarPY - Time Series Pre and Post Processing Methods

[GitHub](https://github.com/celmore25/TimeWarPY)
[Full Documentation](https://timewarpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Background and Objective

TimeWarPy is a library I created because I kept running into time-series related pre and post processing that is discussed a lot in ML literature but not standardized in a popular ML library. Most industry related forecasting methods are not well suited for real-time deep learning architectures. TimeWarPy is a stab at making these operations both fast and convenient for real-time applications through an easy to use set of core processing objections.

## Installation

TimeWarPY can be installed directly with PyPi or directly from source [here](https://github.com/celmore25/TimeWarPY)

```
pip install timewarpy
```
