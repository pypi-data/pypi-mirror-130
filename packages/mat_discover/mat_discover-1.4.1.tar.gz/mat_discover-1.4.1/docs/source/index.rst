Welcome to mat_discover's documentation!
========================================

Descending from Stochastic Clustering Variance Regression (DiSCoVeR) is a
composition-based materials
discovery algorithm geared towards exploring high-performance candidates in new chemical
spaces as originally proposed by `Baird, Diep, and Sparks
<https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/617883e30f3eeb18ee723587>`_. The
library `mat_discover` provides a GPU-accelerated (and CPU-compatible) Python
implementation and tools for analyzing the outputs. `mat_discover` will "suggest your
next best experiment" using a custom dataset of chemical formula and target properties
in just a few lines of code!
