class macro_model:
    """
    Model class to assign equations, variables, parameters, options, constraints, etc. Once 
    the model is defined by the user, upon calling the :code:`run` method, the jacobians are 
    computed and the model is run to convergence.
    
    Parameters
    ------------
    name: str
        Name of the model. This will be used in file names when saving down solution files (the file name
        will consist of the time, date, and model name). This is also used for the visualization application.
        
    Attributes
    -------------
    options: PyMacroFin.parameters.options
        An options class with highly configurable options (documentation :ref:`here <options-documentation>`.
        When a :code:`macro_model` object is instantiated, this attribute is created with default values that 
        can be modified by the user.
    parameters: PyMacroFin.parameters.parameters
        An attribute to house model parameters. An empty parameters object is created upon :code:`macro_model` 
        instantiation. See documentation :ref:`here <parameters-documentation>`.

        Notes

        Add a boundary condition for endogenous variable values to the model.
        
        Parameters
        ------------
        boundary_: dict
            This boundary must be of the following form: :code:`{'state':'bound_type'}` where 'state' is the name of the state
            variable as a string and 'bound_type' is either :code:`'min'` or :code:`'max'`. For example, if my state variables were 
            :code:`'e'` and :code:`'z'` and I would like to create a boundary condition for the grid boundary where :code:`'e'` takes 
            its minimum value, I would set this argument equal to :code:`{'e':'min'}`. You can specify boundaries at corners by giving 
            the dictionary two entries as follows: :code:`{'e':'min','z':'max'}`.
        condition: function
            A function that accepts a dictionary as an input with state variable and parameter names as keys (and appropriate values as 
            dictionary values). This function should return a vector of endogenous variable values (with the same order as input with 
            :code:`macro_model.set_endog`).
            
        Notes
        -------------
        
        1. While the function should accept a dictionary as an argument, the function is not required to use any entries in the dictionary. A boundary unrelated to parameters and state variable values may be defined.
        2. Allowing boundaries to be specified by user-defined functions allows for high flexibility in defining boundary conditions as opposed to using the equation definition format.
