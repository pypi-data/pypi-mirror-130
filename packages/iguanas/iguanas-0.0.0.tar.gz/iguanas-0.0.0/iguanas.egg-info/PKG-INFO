        # What is Iguanas?
        
        Iguanas is a fast, flexible and modular Python package for:
        
        * Generating new fraud-capture rules using a labelled dataset.
        * Optimising existing rules using a labelled or unlabelled dataset.
        * Combining rule sets and removing/filtering those which are unnecessary.
        * Generating rule scores based on their performance.
        
        It aims to help streamline the process for developing a deployment-ready Rules-Based System (RBS) for **binary classification use cases**.
