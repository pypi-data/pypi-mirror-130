    <h2>Entering a model</h2>

            <img style="max-width:100%" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='quickstart-1.png') }}" alt="Main page with the model A=B, B=A">
        </aside>
        <p>
            Enter the model in the textbox
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each equation should be of the form "var=formula"</li>
            <li>Each variable must show up exactly once as a left-hand-side of one of these equationa</li>
            <li>Capitilization matters! Two variables with the same letters but different
                capitilizations are considered distinct.
            </li>
            <li>The formula may contain +, -, *, ^, MAX, MIN, and NOT.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you have entered the model, click on the submit button. On the backend, we do a quick
            check to make sure each line is of the form var=formula, but do no other checking.</p>
        <p>For this example, we will use a very simple model with two variables, A and B.</p>

<section class="w3-container">
    <h2>Selecting model options</h2>
    <article>
        <aside class="w3-container w3-grey w3-margin w3-border-large w3-right">
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='quickstart-2.png') }}" alt="Model options page">
        </aside>
        <p>
            With the model entered, we are presented with several options
        <ul>
            <li>Each variable (or all variables) may be made "continuous"; meaning that the model will
                be altered so that no quantity may jump more than 1 level in each time step. Check the
                corresponding box for any variable you wish to be continuous. The box in the column heading
                toggles the entire column.
            </li>
            <li>Each variable may be <em>forced</em> to either be over-expressed (2), at base-line (1),
                or knocked-out (0) using the dropdown menus in the Forcing column.
            </li>
            <li>Using the radio-buttons near the bottom, we may select either
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Sample fixed points and cycles.</b> In which we generate a uniform random sample
                        of starting points in the configuration space (quantity choosable via dropdown) and let
                        them evolve via the model until they either arrive at a fixed point or cycle. Statistics
                        are generated on number of starting points which are in the basin of attraction for each
                        cycle or fixed point found. We <em>do not guarantee</em> that all cycles or fixed points
                        will be found.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Find all fixed points.</b> In which we use computer algebra software to find all
                        fixed points. Here we <em>guarantee</em> that all fixed points will be found. However,
                        this algorithm will not find cycles and does not give any information on the size of the
                        basin of attraction.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        Once you have made your choices, click on the submit button.
        </p>
        <p>The computation will hopefully be quick, but is not instantaneous. Expect a short wait; the
            next page will be rendered once the server is finished simulating. </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <article>
        <aside class="w3-container w3-grey w3-margin w3-border-large w3-right">

        </aside>
        <p>
            Here we show the (bottom part) of the results page for a run where we choose to sample the
            fixed points and cycles.
        <ul>
            <li>Cycles are labeled by their lengths (fixed points being cycles of length 1) and by their
                sequence.
            </li>
            <li>In red, we present the percentage and count of sampled points which are in the basin of
                attraction for the cycle.
            </li>
            <li>If you desire to use save the generated data, the button 'Download tsv' will generate a
                tab separated value called model_results.tsv which contains the displayed data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
