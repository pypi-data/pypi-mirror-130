# AndEggs

AndEggs is a Python library that allows you to create an email bot using Gmail's API.

# Simple Documentation

## Client Class

The `Client` class will be the main entry point of your program. 

### Create a Client

First, create a new client by calling the `Client` constructor:

```python
    >>> from andeggs import Client
    >>> client = Client('CommandPrefix')
```

Then, you can use the `Client` object to interact with Gmail's API.

### Creating a Command

To create a command, you should create an asynchronous function that will be called when the command is triggered.
It should take in a `MailContext` object as its only parameter. This object contains all the information about the email that triggered the command.
To turn it into a command, use the `Client.command` decorator:

```python
    >>> @client.command('CommandName')
    >>> async def command(context: MailContext):
    >>>     # Do something
    >>>     pass
```

### Sending an Email

To send an email, you should use the `Client.send` method:

```python
    >>> client.send(
    >>>     to='RecipientEmail',
    >>>     subject='Subject',
    >>>     body='Body',
    >>>     is_html=False,
    >>> )
```

### Activating the Client

To activate the client, you should call the `Client.run` method:

```python
    >>> client.run('youremail', 'yourpassword')
```

### Events

Events are triggered when certain actions happen. Below is a list of the events that can be triggered and their parameters:

* `on_ready`: Triggered when the client is started.
* `on_message`: Triggered when a new email is received. The parameter is a `MailContext` object.
* `on_send`: Triggered when an email is sent. The parameter is a `MailContext` object.
* `on_command`: Triggered when a command is triggered. The parameter is a `MailContext` object.
* `on_stop`: Triggered when the client is stopped.

### Tasks

A task is a function that runs in the background. You can use the `Client.task` decorator to create a task:

```python
    >>> @client.task(interval=60)
    >>> async def task():
    >>>     # Do something
    >>>     pass
```

## MailContext

On all of your commands, you will receive a `MailContext` object. This object contains all the information about the email that triggered the command.

### Attributes
- `sender`: A `Sender` object.
- `subject`: The subject of the email.
- `body`: The body of the email.

### Sending an Email

You can also send an email using the `MailContext.send` method:

```python
    >>> context.send(
    >>>     'Body',
    >>> )
```

If you want to format your text with html, you should use the `MailContext.sendf` method:

```python
    >>> context.sendf(
    >>>     '<p>{}</p>',
    >>>     'Body',
    >>> )
```
