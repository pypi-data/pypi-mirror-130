Options:
  Access Token sources: [mutually_exclusive]
                                  The sources for retrieving an Access Token,
                                  in the order they are checked. If no source
                                  is specified, it will try to retrieve the
                                  supported token issuer from the service.
    --token TOKEN                 Pass token directly. Environment variables
                                  are checked in given order.  [env var:

    --iss, --issuer URL           URL of token issuer. Configured account in
                                  oidc-agent for this issuer will be used.
                                  Environment variables are checked in given
                                  order.  [env var: OIDC_ISS, OIDC_ISSUER]
  motley_cue options:
    --mc-endpoint URL             motley_cue API endpoint. Default URLs are
                                  checked in given order: https://HOSTNAME,
                                  https://HOSTNAME:8443, http://HOSTNAME:8080
    --insecure                    Ignore verifying the SSL certificate for
                                  motley_cue endpoint, NOT RECOMMENDED.
    --no-cache                    Do not cache HTTP requests.
  Verbosity:
    --debug                       Sets the log level to DEBUG.
    --log-level LEVEL             Either CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO or
                                  DEBUG. Default value: ERROR.  [env var: LOG]
  Help:
    -h, --help                    Show this message and exit.
    -V, --version                 Show the version and exit.

Commands:
  info  get info about service
  scp   secure file copy
  sftp  secure file transfer
  ssh   remote login client
```

You can also use the help option on each subcommand, eg:
```sh
mccli ssh --help
```

First, you'll need an OIDC Access Token to authenticate.
You might want to check out the [oidc-agent](https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent) for that.

After you get the `oidc-agent` running, configure an account for your OP.
For example, if you generated an account named `egi` for the [EGI AAI](https://aai.egi.eu/oidc), you can set this in an environment variable:
```sh
export OIDC_AGENT_ACCOUNT=egi
```
Then, assuming that the ssh server has a [motley_cue](https://github.com/dianagudu/motley_cue) instance running on the same host at https://$SSH_SERVER or http://$SSH_SERVER:8080, you can connect to the ssh server simply by:
```sh
mccli ssh $SSH_SERVER
```
Or get the sshpass command that you can run instead:
```sh
mccli ssh $SSH_SERVER --dry-run
```
