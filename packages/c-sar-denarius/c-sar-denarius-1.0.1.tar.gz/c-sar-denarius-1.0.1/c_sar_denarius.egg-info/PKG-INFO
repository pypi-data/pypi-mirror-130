## Publications

Please contact the following for appropriate referencing methods:

- Keiran Raine (kr2@sanger.ac.uk)
- Clare Pacini (cp16@sanger.ac.uk)
- Victoria Offord (vo1@sanger.ac.uk)

## Commands

Basic command line information is provided by running the bare command:

```bash
$ c-sar-denarius
Usage: c-sar-denarius [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  markdown  Generate (or extend existing) c-sar-denarius site from a...
  server    Serve the result of a pre-existing target area.
```

Each subcommand has more detailed documentation.

### markdown

This command will generate or extend an existing target location using data from the `c-sar` results folder.

Please see `--help` on the subcommand for details of the options.

### server

Provides a basic webserver on the current host to serve the generated site.  Basic authentication is provided for use on
an internal network, but this is only intended for use by a small number of users.  Consider using a more robust server
for long term presentation of data.

Please see `--help` on the subcommand for details of the options.

## Installation

### Pypi

```bash
pip install c-sar-denarius
# for basic server components
pip install https://github.com/elfgoh/sauth/archive/15dbca865332e7b83ccf5d9d227d0321a88132ca.tar.gz
```

### Docker and Singularity

There are pre-built images containing this codebase on [quay.io][quay-repo].  When pulling an image you must specify
the version there is no `latest`.

The docker images are known to work correctly after import into a singularity image.

## Development environment

This allows you to run all appropriate pre-commit tests.

### pre-commit

Please install a pre-commit to your user environment (not a venv):

```bash
curl https://pre-commit.com/install-local.py | python3 -
# may need to add to PATH
```

### Python env

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r tests/test-requirements.txt

python setup.py develop # so bin scripts can find module
# If this is merged and pypi available move sauth into setup.py
# https://github.com/Granitosaurus/sauth/pull/1
pip install https://github.com/elfgoh/sauth/archive/15dbca865332e7b83ccf5d9d227d0321a88132ca.tar.gz

# enable pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Updating licence headers

Please use [skywalking-eyes](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-eyes).

Expected workflow:

```bash
# recent build, change to apache/skywalking-eyes:0.2.0 once released
export DOCKER_IMG=ghcr.io/apache/skywalking-eyes/license-eye
```

1. Check state before modifying `.licenserc.yaml`:
   - `docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace $DOCKER_IMG header check`
   - You should get some 'valid' here, those without a header as 'invalid'
1. Modify `.licenserc.yaml`
1. Apply the changes:
   - `docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/github/workspace $DOCKER_IMG header fix`
1. Add/commit changes

The check is executed in the CI pipeline which will fail if expected files are missing the license.

*DO NOT* edit the header in the files, please modify the date component of `content` in `.licenserc.yaml`.  The only files needing manual update being:

- `README.md`

If you need to make more extensive changes to the license carefully test the pattern is functional.
