# Marley Tech AWS CDK Construct Library

A collection of useful AWS CDK Constructs.

## Constructs

### EventFunction

A Construct which provides the resource for triggering a Lambda Function via a EventBridge Rule. It includes the Dead Letter Queues for the delivery and the processing of the event.

![Event Function Architecture Diagram](docs/EventFunction/EventFunction.png)

The Event Function Lambda is given the following Environment Variables:

* `PROCESSING_DLQ_ARN` - the SQS Queue ARN of the Processing DLQ (to assist the Lambda Code to publish failed messages to this queue)
* `PROCESSING_DLQ_NAME` - the SQS Queue Name of the Processing DLQ (to assist the Lambda Code to publish failed messages to this queue)

#### Resources

This Construct deploy the following resources:

* Rule (EventBridge Rule) - The trigger or event rule which will be passed to the Event Function
* Event Function (Lambda Function) - The code which will be executed
* Delivery DLQ (SQS Queue) - A DLQ which undeliverable Events are pushed to (e.g. if the Event Function is unreachable)
* Processing DLQ (SQS Queue) - A DLQ which the Event Fucntion may push Events to if it considers the Event to be unprocessable (e.g. if the Event is in an unexpected structure)

##### Alarms

The SQS Queues which act as DLQs have Alarms configured which are triggered when messages are posted to them. To subscribe to these Alarms, provide an SNS Topic for each DLQ.
