# Covert Format Specification

## File structure

A file begins with a cryptographic header, followed by one or more encrypted authenticated blocks. The sole purpose of the header is to provide the keys needed to decrypt all the blocks where all remaining data is stored. Each block identifies if it is followed by more blocks, and if so, the block length. Signed files append 80-byte signature blocks at the end for each signature (as identified within the file). The whole stream is self-contained, it knows where it stops, and does not need to rely on end-of-file for that.

`header` `block0` `block1`...`blockN` `signature`*

The header contains tokens neded for decrypting block0, given suitable passwords or private keys. `ephash` stores an ephemeral public key hash, even if only passwords are used (but may be substituted by random bytes then). The nonce is always the initial 12 bytes of a file, either as a separate field (short mode) or by stealing bytes of `ephash` (advanced mode). There may be up to 20 recipients, each a shared password or a public key. A short mode is provided for simple cases where 12 bytes header overhead is sufficient. Otherwise the header size is 32 bytes times the number of recipients, although decoy entries filled with random bytes may be added to obscure the number of recipients.

| Header format | Mode | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `nonce:12` | Short | Single password `key = argon2(pw, nonce)` or wide-open `key = zeroes(32)`. |
| `ephash:32` | Advanced | Single pubkey `key = sha512(nonce + ecdh(eph, receiver))[:32]` |
| `ephash:32` `auth1:32` `auth2:32` ... | Advanced | Multiple authentication methods (pubkeys and/or passwords). |

The short mode saves space for the commonly used single password and wide-open cases, versus using the advanced mode. The header is only 12 bytes and the auth key is directly used as the file key used to encrypt all the blocks.

The advanced mode uses 0-19 *additional authentication slots*, thus the header size varies between 32-640 bytes. Note that the single pubkey and the multiple auth modes actually share the same implementation and are shown here separately only for illustration. 32-byte keys for each individual auth are derived as in the single password/pubkey modes and stored in `keys` array. Entries with random 32 bytes may be added to obscure the number of recipients.

It is critical to **eliminate any duplicates** within the `keys` array, caused by duplicate passwords or recipient keys. Be sure to do this *after* any processing of recipient strings, as different input formats could be producing the same key (depending on your implementation), but it is recommended filter out duplicates also before any hashing (provides depth of security and avoids calculating the same keys multiple times).

The first key becomes the file key `key = keys[0]`, while the additional auth slots are filled with `authn = key âŠ• keys[n]` (xorred with the file key). The receiver tries opening a file using any of his keys directly as key on block0 or by xorring it with each 32-byte auth slot (up to 19 of them, if permitted by file size).

Each block is encrypted and authenticated by chacha20-poly1305, using nonce and key derived from header. Block0 is mandatory. Its starting offset depends on the number of recipients, and it ends at any byte up to 1024 offset from file beginning. All combinations of slots, methods and block offsets must be attempted until the decryption succeeds, as verified by the Poly1305 authentication. This takes very little time and false matches are impossible.

Block0 has as *additional authenticated data* all header bytes (i.e. everything until the position where the block begins), to prevent any manipulation. Other blocks have no AAD. The nonce is incremented in little endian (i.e. the lowest bit of the first byte always changes). Block0 uses the same nonce as the header, the second block one greater than the first, etc. The key stays the same throughout the file but is different on each new file even if identical authentication was used.

Block: `data` `nextlen:3` `polytag:16`

The polytag comes directly from the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm and is automatically added/removed by cryptographic libraries. The nextlen field is an uint24 denoting the number of data bytes in the next block. If the value is 0, reading stops and no more blocks are processed, thus this format requires no information of where the stream ends but can provide for that information internally.

Only the first block can have zero bytes of data and only when the file is completely empty. Otherwise each block including the last one must carry at least one byte of data. A block can be up to 16 MiB + 18 bytes in external size (nextlen max value plus 19 bytes of structures).

The data stored here, as concatenated from all the blocks, is referred to as the raw stream, and it can be of any length of bytes from 0 to infinity. For normal use, the Covert files always contain archive data.

## Archive format

### Overview

Inside the raw stream, there is a separate msgpack-based container format that allows multiple file attachments, signatures and other features not supported by the plain block stream. The archive is independent of the block layer, and any of its structures may pass block boundaries. For purposes of real-time streaming, an encoder may manipulate block lengths to allow immediate transmission of data over the pipes.

Only the index header and other structures use [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) objects. Data is stored as plain bytes rather than msgpack binary objects to reduce the space needed and to increase performance because msgpack is not well suited for very large data.

### Layout

* Short format: `size:int` `file1-data` `padding`
* Advanced format: `index:dict` `file1-data` `file2-data`... `padding`

The decoder knows which format is being used by the type of the first non-NIL msgpack object found.

Typical short messages can be stored in the short format with a minimal overhead of only one byte. The advanced format has a very moderate overhead which should be insignificant in any situations where it might be needed. Data from different files can be simply concatenated because the index already tells their sizes. The advanced format also supports streaming of files for which the size is not known in advance (each chunk of data begins with len:int and the file ends when the length is zero).

### The Index

The short format int value `size` maps to the following advanced format index and vice versa. Implementations are expected to perform this conversion, so we can discuss only the advanced format:

```javascript
{f: [[size, null, {}]]}
```

Advanced index is a dictionary, optionally with key `f` containing a list of files.

Each file entry is a list `[size, filename, meta]`. If size is null, the file uses streaming (length before each chunk of data). Filename is null for messages, a string for attachments / archived files. Meta is a dictionary that may contain additional flags but is usually empty. Currently only `{x: True}` is defined for UNIX executable files.

As of now no other index fields are specified, but likely additions include `s` key with a list of sender/signature information. [X3DH](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/) and [Double Ratchet](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/) metadata are also possible additions.

### Padding

The padding is a randomly chosen number of `\xC0` bytes (msgpack NILs), and it can be added at any point where msgpack is expected, although typically it is left until the end of archive. A preferred size should be chosen e.g. as a proportion such as 5 % of total size. The maximum preferred size can be clamped to some upper bound to limit the waste of space. Never clamp the actual size, as doing so defeats the purpose of padding. The actual value is picked from the exponential distribution:

```python
padsize = int(round(random.expovariate(1.0 / size)))
```

This gives good variation in the ciphertext length, such that one cannot guess the length and the meaning of a message by looking at the size of the ciphertext. The *mean length* will be `size` bytes. Most of the time the padding is shorter than that but occassionally it can be many times longer.

![Padding size](https://github.com/covert-encryption/covert/raw/main/docs/in-out.webp)
Message data is shown in grey, and the padding added on top of it in orange. Covert padding is randomized, visualised by fading shades of orange. Another currently popular padding scheme Padme is shown for comparison. Covert implements fixed size padding for small files making anything smaller than that look exactly the same. If there is more content, there will on average be less padding, and not even the distribution of the randomness varies on such small files. Covert always adds a random component such that each size of output corresponds to a large scale of input sizes and datasets cannot easily be identified by the sizes that appear in output. Padme reveals small file sizes exactly and for each output size there is only a strict range of possible input sizes.

The deterministic approach may seem better if an adversary can somehow request the file to be encrypted many times to collect data on variation of size knowing that the target is always the same. For most practical uses, randomness is a better choice.

![Output size distribution](https://github.com/covert-encryption/covert/raw/main/docs/distribution.webp)
If only specific known sizes are produced, it may be possible to identify which scheme was used. The output file sizes should be distributed such that any byte size is likely to occur. Padme produces only a set of very distinct sizes, so if an adversary were to discover a set of files containing *only* such sizes, or even just one larger file that happens to be exactly on one of the padme sizes, he can reasonably assert that it is in fact padme-padded encrypted data. Covert maintains confidentiality and deniability by producing output file sizes that reveal very little of either the content or the packaging.

The amount of padding, along with the fixed size level, may be adjusted by the `--pad` parameter on covert CLI to cater for different security and space usage trade offs.

## Signatures

Signatures may be added after the otherwise final block, or as separate detached files, with the intention that signatures may be added and removed without rewriting the original file, which would invalidate any existing signatures. The signatures also look like random data, although the same bytes are produced if the same key signs the same file again. There may be multiple signature blocks appended to a file.

Rather than hashing all the data, the Poly1305 tags already calculated for each block are used. This is far faster than running the slow hash function over the entire data and yet provides equal protection.

```python
h = ""
for ciphertext in blocks:
    h = sha512(h + ciphertext[-16:])  # Poly1305 tag
filehash = h
```

The hashes form a *blockchain* where signing the final hash is sufficient to prove that no modification to the data was made at any point.

A signature block is 80 bytes, containing a 64-byte signature encrypted into a single Chacha20-Poly1305 block, where the encryption *key* is `filehash[:32]` and the *nonce* is `hash(filehash + pk)[:12]`, where pk is the recipient public key (32 bytes). Possession of both the **full original file** and the **public key** used to sign is necessary to even decrypt the signature, even if the original file used `--wide-open`, as keys are not stored with the signature itself.

Once decrypted, the signature data MUST be verified using the [XEd25519](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/) algorithm because simply opening the block gives no verification. The final block hash is the *message* to sign. For this part, the normal Curve25519 (Montegomery) used for block cipher need to be converted to the corresponding Ed25519 keys, which are only used once the signature block is decrypted, to verify the signature itself.

The archive index may specify that the file is signed, including the corresponding public key and name. This allows for key exchange and prevents anyone but the intended recipients from removing that signature without being noticed.

## Ascii armor

Covert files and detached signatures may be converted into text strings that are easy to copy&paste e.g. on online discussions. A Covert message can even fit in a Tweet. URL-safe Base64 without padding is used.

There are no headers to make it distinct of any random data encoded in Base64, but for maximal privacy and the best performance, raw binary files should be used instead whenever possible.


## Argon2 password hashing

### Overview

Password authentication is tricky because there simply is not enough entropy in passwords that people are willing to type in and memorize. The minimum password length is **8 bytes** and for such weak passwords very slow hashing is used to keep them secure, while longer passwords get faster hashing.

All password inputs must be converted into Unicode Normalization Form KC, `NFKC`, and then encoded as UTF-8 bytes. This is to ensure compatibility between devices (Apple and Microsoft have incompatible encodings).

The Argon2 hashing is performed in two stages with distinct functions.
* Stage 1 is adaptive to password length, producing a 16 byte `pwhash`.
* Stage 2 combines the `pwhash` with the unique `nonce` of each file.

```python
# Normalize and encode
pw_bytes = normalize("NFKC", password).encode("UTF-8")

# Stage 1
time_cost = 8 << max(0, 12 - len(pw_bytes))
pwhash = argon2id(hashlen=16, salt="covertpassphrase", password=pw_bytes, time_cost=time_cost)

# Stage 2
authkey = argon2id(hashlen=32, salt=pwhash, password=nonce, time_cost=2)
```

The `pwhash` may be kept in device RAM or in a secure keystore in case multiple files need to be processed, avoiding some slow hashing and keeping the original password always secure. The second stage is much faster but adds necessary protection against rainbow tables and provides each file with a unique `authkey` even when the same password is reused. See the **File structure** section above for further discussion on the auth keys.

### Stage 1: Argon2 on password

|Parameter|Passphrase bytes|Value|
|---|---:|---|
|hash_len||16|
|time_cost|8|128|
||9|64|
||10|32|
||11|16|
||â‰¥ 12|8|
|mem_cost||256 MiB|
|parallelism||1|
|type||Argon2id|

The salt is always `covertpassphrase` (16 bytes)

### Stage 2: Argon2 on nonce and pwhash

|Parameter|Value|
|---|---|
|hash_len|32|
|time_cost|2|
|mem_cost|256 MiB|
|parallelism|1|
|type|Argon2id|

Notice that in this stage the roles of salt and password are reversed because libsodium requires a salt of exactly 16 bytes, matching the pwhash but not the 12-byte nonce.

## Miscellaneus details

### Extensions

Single character dict keys are reserved to the format. Users may add custom metadata to any dict by using multi-letter key names.

The use of any unnecessary metadata, e.g. any names of programs used, is heavily discouraged.

### Ephemeral key hashing

A fresh ephemeral keypair is created for each Covert file. This is part of a standard ECDH exchange that makes up the public key system. The ephemeral public key is written to the file so that the recipient can, together with his secret key, decrypt the contents. The sender derives a shared key using the ephemeral secret key with the recipient public key and the immediately destroys the ephemeral key, so that he can no longer open the file.

A plain public key if stored in the header could be verified by outsiders as a valid key (with 25 % likelyhood of being just random data). Instead, Elligator2 hashing is used such that all bits are indistinguishable from random data. As per Elligator2, one needs to create random ephemeral keys until one that fits the encoding is found (half of attempts fail). Three additional random bits are needed in encoding, one for v coordinate sign that gets scrambled and stored in the hash, and two others to fill the otherwise zero high bits of Elligator2 output.

The receiver reverses this process, masking out the two high bit, then unhashing to recover the u coordinate (i.e. the ephemeral public key), while ignoring the v coordinate and its sign (Curve25519 never uses the v coordinate).

Depending on the sign bit two very distinct hashes as created, each in four variations by the other two bits in the final byte. Each of these eight possibilities should be produced equally likely, and each of them should be restored to identical bytes as the source key. Implementation of Elligator2 vary in their choice of the non-square value, making hashes incompatible. Covert uses value 2, while some implementations might be using sqrt(-1). Verify your code against the following test vectors:

```

c914aa274bb2ebfadf735eab268417e8f292712d9c05fa399aee7972b99f1ac0
```

The inverse hash should restore each of the variations to the exact same bytes as the original key.

### Endianess

All integers are unsigned and encoded in **little endian**, unless specified otherwise by foreign formats such as MsgPack (which is big endian).

### Character encoding

Text given as a message in terminal or other text input should be normalized by removing any trailing whitespace on each line. Lines must be terminated by LF only. There is no LF after the final line, all trailing newlines should be removed.

All Unicode, filenames and passwords in particular, must be normalized into **NFKC format**. Apple devices natively use NFD, which causes problems with passwords and filenames if not properly normalized. Strings extracted from Covert files should alike be transformed back to platform-native format as needed.

Finally, strings are always encoded in UTF-8 without BOM. Any text stored in MsgPack objects uses the string rather than the binary format.

### Real-time streaming

If the file length is not known in advance, no length is given in the index, and instead a MsgPack int object before each chunk tells how many bytes to read. Such a file is terminated by a MsgPack 0. Usually this occurs in a non-realtime context where the encoder may wait until a full block is done before sending it out.

The format also supports transmission of smaller blocks without delay. This requires coordination between the archive and the block layer regarding the next block lengths. It is recommended to choose a reasonably large next size (e.g. 1024) even if the data length is not known, and to fill any unused space with padding if needed, rather than to create 1-byte blocks with a huge overhead just to be safe.
