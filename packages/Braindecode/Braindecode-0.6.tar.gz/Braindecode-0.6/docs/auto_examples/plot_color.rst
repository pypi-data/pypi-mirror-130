Next, we will chain several preprocessing steps that are realized through
`mne`. Data will be loaded by the first preprocessor that has a mention of it
in brackets:

#. crop the recordings to a region of interest
#. re-reference all recordings to 'ar' (requires load)
#. rename channels to short channel names
#. pick channels of interest
#. scale signals to microvolts (requires load)
#. resample recordings to a common frequency (requires load)
#. create compute windows
