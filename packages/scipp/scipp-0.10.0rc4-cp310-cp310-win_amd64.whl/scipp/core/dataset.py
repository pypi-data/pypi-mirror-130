def combine_masks(masks, labels, shape):
    """
    Combine all masks into a single one following the OR operation.
    This requires a masks view as an input, followed by the
    dimension labels and shape of the Variable/DataArray. The
    labels and the shape are used to create a Dimensions object.
    The function then iterates through the masks view and combines
    only the masks that have all their dimensions contained in the
    Variable/DataArray Dimensions.

    :param masks: Masks view of the dataset's masks.
    :param labels: A list of dimension labels.
    :param shape: A list of dimension extents.
    :type masks: MaskView
    :type labels: list
    :type shape: list
    :return: A new variable that contains the union of all masks.
    :rtype: Variable
