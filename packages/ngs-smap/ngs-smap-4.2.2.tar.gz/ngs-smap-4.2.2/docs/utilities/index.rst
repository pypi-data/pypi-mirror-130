SMAP utilities
==============

| This is the manual for the complementary Utilities scripts of the SMAP-package.
| The first step prior to running **SMAP haplotype-sites** is the definition of the locus start and end points.
| For HiPlex and Shotgun data these can be created using Python scripts provided in the Utility tools.
| For GBS data, **SMAP delineate** should be run to define relevant loci and read mapping polymorphisms in a data-driven manner.
