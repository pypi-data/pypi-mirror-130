class Solver:
    """Solver class for simulating both Hamiltonian and Lindblad dynamics, with high
    level type-handling of input states.

    Given the components of a Hamiltonian and optional dissipators, this class will
    internally construct either a :class:`HamiltonianModel` or :class:`LindbladModel`
    instance.

    Transformations on the model can be specified via the optional arguments:

    * ``rotating_frame``: Transforms the model into a rotating frame. Note that
      operator specifying the frame will be substracted from the static_hamiltonian.
      If supplied as a 1d array, ``rotating_frame`` is interpreted as the diagonal
      elements of a diagonal matrix. See :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.models.RotatingFrame` for details.
    * ``in_frame_basis``: Whether to represent the model in the basis in which the frame
      operator is diagonal, henceforth called the "frame basis".
      If ``rotating_frame`` is ``None`` or was supplied as a 1d array,
      this kwarg has no effect. If ``rotating_frame`` was specified as a 2d array,
      the frame basis is hte diagonalizing basis supplied by ``np.linalg.eigh``.
      If ``in_frame_basis==True``, calls to ``solve``, this objects behaves as if all
      operators were supplied in the frame basis: calls to ``solve`` will assume the initial
      state is supplied in the frame basis, and the results will be returned in the frame basis.
      If ``in_frame_basis==False``, the system will still be solved in the frame basis for
      efficiency, however the initial state (and final output states) will automatically be
      transformed into (and, respectively, out of) the frame basis.
    * ``rwa_cutoff_freq``: Performs a rotating wave approximation (RWA) on the model
      with cutoff frequency ``rwa_cutoff_freq``. See
      :func:`~qiskit_dynamics.models.rotating_wave_approximation`
      for details.

      .. note::
            When using the ``rwa_cutoff_freq`` optional argument,
            :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.solvers.solver_classes.Solver` cannot be instantiated within
            a JAX-transformable function. However, after construction, instances can
            still be used within JAX-transformable functions regardless of whether an
            ``rwa_cutoff_freq`` is set.

    .. note::
        Modifications to the underlying model after instantiation may be made
        directly via the ``model`` property of this class. However,
        the getting and setting of model signals should be done via the ``signals`` property
        of this class, which manages signal transformations required in
        the case that a rotating wave approximation is made.

    The evolution given by the model can be simulated by calling
    :meth:`~qiskit_dynamics.solvers.Solver.solve`, which calls
    calls :func:`~qiskit_dynamics.solve.solve_lmde`, and does various automatic
    type handling operations for :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` state and super operator types.

                determined by the model type and evaluation mode.
             * If ``y0`` is a subclass of :class:`qiskit.quantum_info.QuantumState`:

                 * If ``self.model`` is a :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.models.LindbladModel`,
                    ``y0`` is converted to a :class:`DensityMatrix`. Further, if the model
                    evaluation mode is vectorized ``y0`` will be suitably reshaped for solving.
                 * If ``self.model`` is a :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.models.HamiltonianModel`,
                    and ``y0`` a :class:`DensityMatrix`, the full unitary will be simulated,
                    and the evolution of ``y0`` is attained via conjugation.

             * If ``y0`` is a subclass of :class`qiskit.quantum_info.QuantumChannel`, the full
                evolution map will be computed and composed with ``y0``; either the unitary if
                ``self.model`` is a :class:`~qiskit_dynamics.models.HamiltonianModel`, or the full
