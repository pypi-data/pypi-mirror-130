 # DeepReader

    DeepReader is an application which intelligently extracts the relevant
    plaintext content from a variety of text types (webpages, ebooks,
    etc.), intelligently "munges" (cleans and restructures) it, and
    intelligently segments it into sentences, for reading.

    I guess the word "intelligent" is being used to convey that
    it is meant to use the most effective general-purpose
    algorithms possible, including machine learning, so that
    it produces basically what a human would produce, given
    a wide variety of formats, scenarios, etc. That is to say, 
    not a method that produces small errors.

    The point is to provide more focus when reading, especially
    when studying dense, difficult information like
    mathematics or programming documentation. It can also
    help people who have some kind of difficulty with reading
    comprehension by breaking lots of text into small, comprehensible
    pieces and provide tools similar to annotation which help you
    note-take and process what you are reading.

    DeepReader is currently in a very simple form and is planned
    to over time significantly develop and mature as an application.
